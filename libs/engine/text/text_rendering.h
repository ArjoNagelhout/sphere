     * The approach for text rendering is to enable the user to load .ttf files on runtime
     * and have the engine convert glyphs on demand into a Signed Distance Field (SDF) representation
     * on a texture atlas or texture array.
     *
     * SDF is required because we're building an engine that will have a lot of UI in VR. This rules out traditional
     * approaches of caching the glyphs in rasterized / bitmap format at a specific font size.

     *
     * Another approach of rendering the font is by parsing it into a vector representation and rendering that using the
     * method described in:

     * Glyphy high runtime cost
     *
     * The results can be cached on disk. If no entry exists on disk, the font file will be parsed and the
     * rendering will be performed.
     *
     * We start out by using the simplest implementation possible using an existing library, and gradually
