     * using descriptor sets
     *
     * how do we bind the graphics pipeline to a given shader?
     * it seems all rather hard coded.
     * can we use a written shader as the basis for creating the
     * pipeline.
     *
     * how many times can we switch between pipelines, do we have to sort them?
     * we have to use a pipeline cache
     *
     * do we want a texture that is both on the CPU and the GPU?
     * or do we upload it to the GPU and leave it there?
     *
     * maybe a distinction similar to RenderTextures in Unity.
